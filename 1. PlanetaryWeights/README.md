# PlanetaryWeights
This project can calculate your weight in other planets.

##How does it work?
Planetary Weights has 3 files:
<li>An HTML file</li>
<li>A JavaScript file</li>
<li>A CSS file</li>
<br>
To calcule your weight in other planets, the program simply just stores the value you type in the input text field (your weight) and then
it does the following calculation:

<div align="center">
userWeight    --- EarthGravity
<br>
planetXWeight --- PlanetXGravity
</div>

<br>

<p align="center">planetXWeight = (userWeight * PlanetXGravity) / EarthGravity</p>
